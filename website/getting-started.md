# Getting Started With Your USB Stick

If you are attending Spark Training in person, you should have a USB stick containing training material. 
If you do not have the USB stick,  <s>you can download a zip file with the contents</s> 
 __This link is removed temporarily to avoid attendees accidentally kicking off a download. 
If you need the usb files to follow along from a remote location, please email__ *training-feedback@databricks.com*

## Quick Start 
After loading the USB key, you should perform the following steps:

<p class="alert alert-warn">
    <i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
    If you are a windows user, please consider using Powershell, or otherwise replace `cd` with `dir`
    and any forward slash (`/`) with a backwards slash (`\`) when navigating directories
    </p>

1. If your USB key  mounted as `NO NAME`, rename it to `SparkTraining` or any other name without a space. 
If you skip this step, you will see your sbt builds fail. 

2. Change directories in to where your USB stick is mounted

    <p class="alert alert-warn">
    <i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
    Throughout the training exercises, all command-line instructions of the form 'usb/$' refer to a 
    terminal that is in the usb directory. Moreover, [usb root directory] refers to the full path to this directory.
    </p>


3. Check your setup by building a toy application. To do this, run the following commands, 
and confirm the results match. If they do, you just built a simple spark application - go look at the
source code to get a feel for what happened.

   ~~~
usb/$ cd simple-app
$ ../sbt/sbt package
$ ../spark/bin/spark-submit --class "SimpleApp" --master local[*] target/scala-2.10/simple-project_2.10-1.0.jar

   ~~~

    <p class="alert alert-warn">
    <i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
    If you do not have a USB key or cannot get the simple app to build, then ask a TA.
    </p>

## USB Contents

You'll find the following contents in the USB stick (this info is taken from the README):
